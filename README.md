# PowerBI
Project objective:
The goal was to analyze call center performance data to gain insights into customer retention, churn, diversity and inclusion, and delivery efficiency. Interactive Power BI dashboards were developed to visualize key metrics and trends, making it easier for stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to improve customer service quality.

Data Used:
Customer Information: Demographic data (age, gender, location) and customer history.
Call Logs: Details on each customer interaction, including call duration, call reason, resolution status, and wait time.
Feedback and Satisfaction: Customer satisfaction scores, feedback comments, and NPS (Net Promoter Score).
Employee Data: Information on call center agents, such as demographics, tenure, and performance metrics.
Delivery Logs: Details on product/service delivery associated with customer inquiries.

Dashboards Created:
1. Customer Retention and Churn Analysis
Objective: Identify patterns in customer retention and churn to understand factors driving customer loyalty and attrition.
Metrics Visualized:

2. Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard
Objective: Track and evaluate diversity among call center employees and ensure equitable treatment and representation.
Metrics Visualized:
Demographic Breakdown: Gender, age, ethnicity, and tenure across departments or shifts.
Performance by Demographic: Compare performance metrics like average call duration, customer satisfaction scores, and resolution time across different groups.
Diversity KPIs: Percentage representation of various demographics in different roles and levels.
Equal Opportunity: Metrics like promotion rate and turnover rate by demographic.

3. Delivery Report
Objective: Assess the efficiency and quality of delivery associated with customer inquiries to identify areas for improvement.
Metrics Visualized:
Delivery Timeliness: On-time vs. delayed delivery rate.
First Contact Resolution (FCR): Percentage of issues resolved within the first call, a critical measure of delivery reliability.
Delivery-Related Complaints: Volume and type of complaints related to delayed or incorrect deliveries.
Customer Feedback: Satisfaction score specific to delivery, identifying geographic or seasonal delivery challenges.


Project Impact:
The interactive dashboards allowed call center managers to monitor and address critical aspects of performance, customer experience, and diversity efforts in real time. The insights gained helped inform strategies to improve customer retention, streamline deliveries, and reinforce diversity and inclusion practices within the organization.
